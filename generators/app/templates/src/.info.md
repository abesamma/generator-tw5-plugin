# About this folder

The `src` folder contains the template files that will be part of the target plugin.
However, the folder structure will vary substantially. The destination folder will look like this:

```text
src
|-- plugins/
    |-- author/
       |-- pluginName/
            | -- plugin.info

```

The folder structure of the template files tries to be as close as possible to the destination
folder structure, however, it is impossible to predict the final destination folder structure
because they will depend on the author and plugin names.
Also note that the files under the `src` directory **are not automatically copied** to the generated plugin,
they should be **explicitly** included on the generator logic.
